WCSTools Installation

WCSTools is a set of software utilities, written in very portable C,
which create, display and manipulate the world coordinate system of
a FITS or IRAF image, using specific keywords in the image header
which relate pixel position within the image to position on the sky.
Auxillary programs search star catalogs and manipulate images.  All
of the programs are run on the command line, but they are designed to
be easily used in scripts.

Brief descriptions of file contents are in the Programs file.
A history of this software is in the NEWS file.

The complete source code is in
ftp://cfa-ftp.harvard.edu/pub/gsc/WCSTools/wcstools-3.8.7.tar.gz and
http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/wcstools-3.8.7.tar.gz

Documentation, with examples and installation directions, is on the
World Wide Web at http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/

To install the code, create a directory for it, download it, and run

        gzcat wcstools-3.8.7.tar.gz | tar xvf -

The directory wcstools-3.8.7 will contain the source code for the programs,
and a subdirectory, libwcs, will contain the source code for the subroutines.

Catalog access subroutines, gscread.c, actread, uacread.c, ubcread.c,
ujcread.c, ty2read.c, tmcread.c, gsc2read.c, and ucacread.c contain
wired-in paths to the root directories of the HST Guide Star Catalog,
the USNO ACT, A2.0 and SA2.0, B1.0, and J Catalogs, the Tycho-2 Catalog,
the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, the GSC II Catalog, and the USNO UCAC[1-3]
catalogs, respectively. You should change the paths in the source files
to match the paths in your local installation. Environment variables may
be also used to override whatever path is in the code: GSC_NORTH sets
the path for the HST GSC CDROM containing the northern hemisphere and
GSC_SOUTH does the same for the southern hemisphere disk. For the
USNO-A2.0 catalog, set the environment variable UA2_PATH to the directory
containing the region files or UA2_ROOT to the directory below which the
CDROMs (ua001, ua002,...ua011) are mounted. For the USNO-B1.0 Catalog,
the environment variable UB1_PATH should be set to the directory
containing the zone subdirectories. Path information for all supported
catalogs is at

http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/wcstools.files.html.  

Type

	make all

or for Solaris,

	make -f Makefile.solaris all

to compile the entire package, or

	make program_name

or for Solaris,

	make -f Makefile.solaris program_name

to compile any of the individual programs. The resulting executable(s)
will be in the bin/ subdirectory. Once again, the programs are listed
in the Programs file.

The WCSTools package has been written to be as portable as possible. The
only conditional code is to deal with VMS vs. Unix and to deal with 64-bit
systems, and even that has been minimized. The package even compiles and runs
under Windows using the free Cygwin environment. If you have any problems,
feel free to write the author.
